# Sudoku Solver (Simulated Annealing)

Sudoku solver made on the grounds of the article [Metaheuristics can solve Sudoku puzzles](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220403361_Metaheuristics_can_solve_Sudoku_puzzles) by Rhydian Lewis.

To use, enter sudoku with `0`s as empty cells, separating numbers with spaces, e.g.
```
5 3 0 0 7 0 0 0 0
6 0 0 1 9 5 0 0 0
0 9 8 0 0 0 0 6 0
8 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 3
4 0 0 8 0 3 0 0 1
7 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 6
0 6 0 0 0 0 2 8 0
0 0 0 4 1 9 0 0 5
0 0 0 0 8 0 0 7 9
```

In the `inputs.h` file there are some example inputs which you can use to test program. If you won't change the code, there is no need to compile that file.
